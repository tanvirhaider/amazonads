            <span class="bold-cap">Every marketer</span> knows their brand is
            much more than a logo and a pithy tagline. And this was never
            clearer than coming out of 2020, when consumers were increasingly
            turning to brands to take action on key issues such as climate
            change, societal contributions, responsible business practices and
            more. Now is the time to speak to your brand values — and mean it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amazon Ads recently commissioned a survey from Environics Research
            about the values that matter most to consumers and found that 83
            percent of U.S. respondents felt more brands should do their part in
            helping the world, especially during difficult times.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The current generation of consumers expects brands to be
            values-driven and advocate for social good,” says Vann Graves, the
            executive director of Brandcenter at Virginia Commonwealth
            University. “To reach consumers, brands must be aware of and take
            part in the larger societal conversations happening in real time.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking for inspiration? Here, we will explore Indeed’s Rising
            Voices program, which brought multiple brands together to give
            opportunities to underrepresented filmmakers. It is a powerful
            example of values-driven advertising in action.

        <div class="box-left">
          <p>
            <span class="bold-cap">The idea</span> for Rising Voices grew from
            the concept that talent is universal but opportunity is not. And
            Indeed wanted to amplify the voices of artists who were BIPOC —
            Black, Indigenous or other people of color. “We thought, ‘What if,
            instead of spending $1 million on a big TV ad, we invested $1
            million for 10 BIPOC creators to produce short films about the
            meaning of work?’” recalls LaFawn Davis, the senior vice president
            of environmental, social and governance at Indeed, the world’s No. 1
            job site. “‘How would their unique perspective on work and life show
            up in these stories?’”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Amazon Ads survey found that 72 percent of U.S. consumers want
            to see more diversity and representation in advertising. And 75
            percent desire to learn more about the customs and heritage of
            racial and ethnic groups in their country. “In today’s competitive
            business climate, brands that choose not to include diverse voices
            may lose credibility among consumers,” according to Graves.
          </p>
          <p>
            In early 2021, Indeed approached Emmy Award-winning artist Lena
            Waithe and Hillman Grad Productions, which aims to provide support
            systems for emerging filmmakers from underrepresented communities.
            Together, they honed the Rising Voices concept: They would give a
            budget of $100,000 to chosen filmmakers and collaborate with each of
            them to create a short film touching on the theme of the meaning of
            work. The films would be screened at the Tribeca Film Festival,
            which was just five months away.

          <p>
            Hillman Grad and Indeed announced the contest on social media and
            picked 11 filmmakers from over 800 scripts that were submitted, to
            create 10 shorts in only six weeks. A married couple, Deondray
            Gossfield and Quincy LeNear Gossfield, entered with a script for
            their powerful short film “Flames,” about former high school friends
            who found themselves at a turning point in their lives and
            relationship. “Deondray and I have been producing television
            together for many years,” says LeNear Gossfield. “Rising Voices is
            helping us make the tough transition to professional studio
            directing, which is what we really love.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed’s Rising Voices program took a stand on inclusivity, provided
            genuine support and mentorship to BIPOC filmmakers and had the
            potential to put meaningful stories from underrepresented
            populations in front of new audiences. But how could they reach a
            large number of viewers all around the country?

          <p>
            <span class="bold-cap">Indeed and Hillman Grad</span> had set in
            motion a fantastic program, but to fulfill their goals, they needed
            a space to amplify the talent of the filmmakers to a large audience.
            That’s why they turned to Amazon Ads, which offered them a wide
            audience through Fire TV, where viewers stream billions of hours
            every month. And with Fire TV’s Stream It Forward program, Amazon
            helped the campaign drive even greater impact by raising money for
            Goodwill, the chosen charity of Indeed, based on hours streamed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ads on Fire TV capture customers’ attention in places they’ve
            chosen to spend time by helping them discover relevant content,”
            says Adam Key, senior marketing manager at Fire TV. “To raise
            awareness of the Rising Voices initiative, Indeed worked with Amazon
            Ads to leverage our most impactful and visual placements on the
            device, including in the feature rotator at the top of the screen.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Amazon Ads survey found that 95 percent of U.S. consumers want
            to decide when and where they interact with a brand. And 80 percent
            of consumers have a strong desire for more human connection. The
            Rising Voices program addressed both needs by providing compelling,
            moving human stories in the short films, which were teased in ad
            content that engaged viewers where and when they were in the mood to
            watch. And people did watch, quickly bypassing the goal of 200,000
            hours streamed on Fire TV and exceeding it by three times.

            “It was incredible,” says Gossfield. “Our faces were everywhere: on

            everywhere. Quincy and I have been doing independent filmmaking for
            so long, but we’d never ever had that kind of ad backing. We got so
            many phone calls and text messages. We felt seen. It was very, very
            humbling.”

              <span class="bold-cap">The best connections</span> are the ones
              built on shared values. Brands must be genuine with consumers,
              build trust and demonstrate how they’re committed. In the Amazon
              Ads survey, 62 percent of U.S. consumers indicate that they’re
              currently purchasing from brands whose values align with their
              own. And 80 percent firmly believe they can vote with their
              dollars by supporting brands that are good corporate citizens. “If
              you’re honest and authentic when you engage with consumers, you
              are in a better position to build a lasting relationship with
              them,” Graves explains. “However, if you lose their trust, it is
              extremely difficult to regain it.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The Rising Voices program has followed through on its mission to
              provide real mentorship and ongoing support for the filmmakers.
              “We are helping the artists find agents and managers to move their
              careers forward,” says Rishi Rajani, president of Hillman Grad.
              “We are also giving them opportunities and working with them on TV
              episodes and feature films. So many of them are doing so well.”

              When brands understand their customers’ needs and values, they can
              be sure they’re telling the right stories to the right audiences
              at the right time — and in the right places. With the Rising
              Voices program and Amazon Ads, Indeed and Hillman Grad were able
              to tell their brand stories to a broad audience and make a lasting
              impact by bringing underrepresented stories directly into their
              homes. And that will continue: Phase two of Rising Voices is
              already in the works.

              “We want to build on top of its success,” Davis says. “I see this
